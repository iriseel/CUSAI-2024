                This course introduces students to graphic design as an expressive and communicative medium. Students are introduced to
                graphic design history, imagery, typography, and symbolism for visual communication. Drawing, digital photography, and
                Adobe software (Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign) are used to execute class assignments. For all assignments, visual
                problem solving will be emphasized. Students will also participate in demos, group discussions, guest lectures, and
                class critiques. This class is for young artists/designers who are excited to learn how images and type can work
                together to communicate ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Class sessions will be structured around group critiques and informal presentations, with occasional guest critics.

                            As you design, consider who the intended audience of your posters are, and where the ideal location for the posters
                            would be to reach your audience. Think about sequencing, cohesion, scale, and composition. In each of your posters, I recommend trying to
                            prioritize just 1 or 2 core visual ideas inspired by your subject.

                                    While you‚Äôre out and about, take note of interesting, attractive, ugly, or otherwise notable typography in your
                                    environment (this can be signage, packaging, stickers, etc.). If possible, bring the object into class, but if not, take
                                    pictures and upload them to our class Are.na / Pinterest channel. We‚Äôll periodically do a ‚Äúshow-and-tell‚Äù of our
                                    selections at the start of class.

                                    works, how it‚Äôs made, and what it looks like formally. How is this an example of graphic design?

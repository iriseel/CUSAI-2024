                This course introduces students to graphic design as an expressive and communicative medium. Students are introduced to
                graphic design history, imagery, typography, and symbolism for visual communication. Drawing, digital photography, and
                Adobe software (Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign) are used to execute class assignments. For all assignments, visual
                problem solving will be emphasized. Students will also participate in demos, group discussions, guest lectures, and
                class critiques. This class is for young artists/designers who are excited to learn how images and type can work
                together to communicate ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Class sessions will be structured around group critiques and informal presentations, with occasional guest critics.

                                    to make each idea as different from the others as possible.

                            Homework: Over the weekend, test out some materials and/or methods that interest you, making letterforms. Ideally, your materials will be either flexible (can be molded into different shapes) or modular (can be stacked/arranged into different shapes). For example, playdough is flexible, while marbles are modular.
                            <li>
                                Come up with at least 2 possible directions for your typeface, and start making letterforms accordingly. (For reference ‚Äî type designers often start with the letterforms ‚Äúa e f g n o‚Äù and ‚ÄúA E F G N O‚Äù.) Take photos of the tests you've done or (if you're making a handwritten typeface) sketches of your letterforms. Bring your chosen materials into class, and be ready to share your ideas, photos, sketches etc.
